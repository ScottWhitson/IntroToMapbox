## Import your data into a Dataset
>*Important* We must first open the geojson in a text editor (WebStorm) and delete the crs line to successfully import a geojson (under 5mb) into mapbox.

>Datasets are layers in your style not an entire geodatabase. Import one layer for each dataset depending on how you want your symbology or style done.
